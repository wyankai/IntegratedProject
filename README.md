# Covid Quiz
Our integrated project is about a covid-19 themed phone application that aims to educate users about covid-19 in Singapore. The objective is to collect masks stranded around the Singapore map and use them to help people involved in a covid-19 cluster around the map too. In order to collect masks in the game, you will need to complete quizzes about covid-19 and earn a certain amount of masks depending on how much you scored on the quiz. By doing these quizzes, users can educate themselves about the virus. Once they complete their action of giving the masks to the NPCs, they will earn a reward that will open and reveal the voucher they have received. This application also has a chat feature with Singaporeans playing the game where you can help one another with the covid-19 quizzes.

## Design Process
 
The design is for the people who want to use a personalised to-do list.
The website stores the user's input into the localStorage so that the User's data would not be lost the moment they reload the screen.

-As the creator of the websote, I want to create a platform for the users for them to store their daily todo-list as well as badges function and a quotes function to help motivate the users.

## Features

Feature 1: Interactive game map that allows the user to drag around the map, zoom in and out and interact with the masks and covid buttons which will pop up a bubble giving the users information.

Feature 2: Statistic Function that help to show the number of cases that has happened, or happen today etc.

Feature 3:Quiz feature is the main action in the game where users do and complete quizzes about covid-19 and earn masks depending on the amount of correct answers they get. Questions are randomly generated for every quiz and are multiple-choice questions. Users have the option to quit the quiz or submit it.

Feature 4:Give masks: When the user has obtained a number of masks, they can interact with the covid button on the game map to give masks to the NPCs in the game. They will have to give away a specific amount of masks in order to achieve the reward.

Feature 5: Reward: Users will get a reward in a gift form. They will have to tap it to open it which reveals various types of vouchers that they might get. The vouchers are real and users can redeem them by proceeding to the store and showing them their screen.

Feature 6: Reward list: The reward list displays all the possible rewards that the user can win, this feature is used mainly to inform them of the vouchers and motivate them to continue playing the game.

Feature 7: Chat: Players can use the chat feature to socialise with people who are also playing the game and discuss the quiz answers. When the user manages to assist another player, they can earn more masks for helping others.

Feature 8: Profile: Users can view their own profile to look at their statistics and also change their username.

Feature 9: Settings:<br>
Dark mode: The dark mode allows the user to have a preference for how the game is displayed on their screen, they can choose to either have bright mode or dark mode for the app.<br>
About this game: Users can learn more about the game through this setting feature. The purpose of the game will be explained and more information about the quizzes and rewards will be provided.
