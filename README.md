# Covid Quiz
Our integrated project is about a covid-19 themed phone application that aims to educate users about covid-19 in Singapore. The objective is to collect masks stranded around the Singapore map and use them to help people involved in a covid-19 cluster around the map too. In order to collect masks in the game, you will need to complete quizzes about covid-19 and earn a certain amount of masks depending on how much you scored on the quiz. By doing these quizzes, users can educate themselves about the virus. Once they complete their action of giving the masks to the NPCs, they will earn a reward that will open and reveal the voucher they have received. This application also has a chat feature with Singaporeans playing the game where you can help one another with the covid-19 quizzes.

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: THE CHAT BUTTON WOULD NOT REDIRECT YOU TO THE CHAT PAGE IF YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE SERVER.<br>
THIS IS MADE SO THAT THE USERS WILL NOT THINK THAT THERE IS A ERROR IN THE CODE AND REALISED THAT THEY DID NOT CONNECT TO THE SERVER.</b>

## Design Process
 
The design is for the philanthrophis users who like to learn about the latest news about covid’19 in Singapore.
The website uses Covid'19 API to display the statistics on the news in Singapore. The website also have a quiz to educate the players on Covid'19.

The design is also for the socialiser users who like to help others for the points, recognition and other visible perks.
The website have a chat function for the players to communicate with one another. Players can use the function to socialise as well as discuss the quiz answers to other players as well as give them advices.

The design will appeal to consumer users who act on the system for the extrinsic rewards..
In the application, when a user manages to complete a NPC’s request, they are given a reward. Some rewards include vouchers as well as gift cards. Consumer users that are not willing to use the app might act on the system for the extrinsic rewards.

-As the creator of the websote, I want to create a platform for the users to learn about Covid as well as a rewards system to motivate them to learn about Covid'19.
