# Covid Quiz
Our integrated project is about a covid-19 themed phone application that aims to educate users about covid-19 in Singapore. The objective is to collect masks stranded around the Singapore map and use them to help people involved in a covid-19 cluster around the map too. In order to collect masks in the game, you will need to complete quizzes about covid-19 and earn a certain amount of masks depending on how much you scored on the quiz. By doing these quizzes, users can educate themselves about the virus. Once they complete their action of giving the masks to the NPCs, they will earn a reward that will open and reveal the voucher they have received. This application also has a chat feature with Singaporeans playing the game where you can help one another with the covid-19 quizzes.

## Usage
```
npm install
npm run dev

Go to localhost:3000
```

## Design Process
 
The design is for the people who want to use a personalised to-do list.
The website stores the user's input into the localStorage so that the User's data would not be lost the moment they reload the screen.

-As the creator of the websote, I want to create a platform for the users for them to store their daily todo-list as well as badges function and a quotes function to help motivate the users.
